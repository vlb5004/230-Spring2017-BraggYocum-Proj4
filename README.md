Project 4: Interaction Graphics on the Web 

# Project Brief

To create an interactive experience educating a person on the history, statistics, and

illustrations of the 7 Wonders of the World. Similar to the online interactive infographic Species

in Pieces, which shows 30 species in the world that are endangered in an immersive experience

online. The 7 Wonders of the World will show 3-7 wonders based on the time into the project

and overall production of the experience. Overall, the designs of each wonder will be simple

with a unique style and construct themselves on each page. Also, the interface to control the

wonder, history, statistics, and illustrations will be designed by us and relate directly to the

overall esthetic we choose.

To complete this project, we (Tori and Maddie) will be partnering up working together through

the design to coding phase. Each have skills in design and programming that works well

together to complete this project fully and create a portfolio piece. Overall we feel this could

become a portfolio sample, not just for design, but also programming within our portfolios for

future employers. We feel strongly about this project and want to create the best project

possible within the 4 weeks, and possibly take it into the summer to expand upon it.

# PARTNER BREAKDOWN
Starting, we each (Tori and Maddie) have similar, yet varying

skillsets. Both have strong skills in design and will work together to create the overall esthetic,

interface, and illustrations. Also, for the programming we plan to work together and try to figure

out new things we need to learn to achieve our project goals. At the end of the project we will

provide a breakdown of exactly who did what within our commits on Github.
